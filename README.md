## Change Log
- I went through the “Typescript for JavaScript” tutorial and completed most of the modules.
- I also went through a website that guides beginners setting up a Web Application with Typescript: [Beginner’s Guide to set up a Web Application with TypeScript](https://codeburst.io/a-beginners-guide-to-setting-up-a-web-application-with-typescript-and-express-e1cf8319bc5c)
- Typescript adds additional syntax to javascript to support a tighter integration with editor. Catch errors early in the editor. ‘Any’ type can save us in moments where needed but it shouldn't be used without valid reason. We can aim towards a better codebase through reducing occurrences of implicitly typed any.
- I went through CSS, HTML, Git tutorials.
- I have made a html page with CSS styling and javaScript: [html page](https://mnawar27.github.io/scratch/), repository link for the html page: [Repo](https://github.com/mnawar27/scratch.git)
- The html page represents some of the clubs and organizations in University of Delaware and gives a short description about the clubs and also it let users count how many clubs they have joined.
 - I also went through javascript tutorial and went through this book named [Eloquent JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics)
 - I went through React, Typscript, Bootstrap tutorials.
 - I have made an application with React, bootstrap and typescript: [Fitness App](https://mnawar27.github.io/fitness-app/), repository link: [Repo](https://github.com/mnawar27/fitness-app.git) 
 - The applcation is a fitness based application which generates important fitness questions about health, fitness and exercise and helps the user to know about fitness by revealing the answers. There are multiple functions in the application such as you can swap question cards, reveal answers, add and shuffle users, even add fitness questions from your own.
 - I also went through this book called [Programming Typescript](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-typescript/9781492037644/) which really made my understanding of typescript stronger.
 - I have also made another react app using typescript [Shopping-Cart-App](https://mnawar27.github.io/react-shopping-cart/), repositopry link: [Repo](https://github.com/mnawar27/react-shopping-cart.git)
 - This is a shopping cart app where you can go through a bunch of products and add stuffs to the cart. If you want to remove any item from your cart you can simply go to the cart and add/remove items as you like. It will also show the amount of your product and total price of your selected items. I also used a free open API for dummy data to the items in the shop. React-query hook is used for fetching the data from the API. Style components is used in combination with Material UI to customize the styles.
